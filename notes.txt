Use virtualenv to create virtual environment for python. Don't want to install qcodes for each environment though. Solution: 
    py-m venv venv --system-site-packages

Creates virtual environment named venv. If pkg not found in venv will backtrack to global system. 
Can share the global qcodes install across environments. 

List python packages with 
pip list --local

In vscode also have to configure python interpreter to be the one defined in the venv
Should now be able to access package anywhere.
