Use virtualenv to create virtual environment for python. Don't want to install qcodes for each environment though. Solution: 
    virtualenv --system-site-packages venv

Creates virtual environment named venv. On package import, if not found in venv, will backtrack to global system. 

Can share the global qcodes install across environments.
